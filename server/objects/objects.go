// BaseObject is the "base" struct for all objects in ToDD. All metadata shared by all todd objects should be stored here.
// Any structs representing todd objects should embed this struct.
//
// Generally, since the "Type" field is present in the "parent", or embedded struct, it is appropriate to first unmarshal YAML
// or JSON into the base "ToddObject" struct first, to determine type. Then, this value is used to determine which "child" struct
// should be used to parse the entire structure, using a "switch" statement, we'll call a "type switch".
//
// The process for adding a new object type in ToDD should be done in 3 places:
//
// - Here, a new struct that embeds ToddObject should be added.
// - The "switch" statement in the ParseToddObject and ParseToddObjects functions below should be augmented to look for the new object type for an incoming YAML file
// - The "Create" function in the client api contains a "type switch" - update this.
//
// It should be mentioned that the steps above only add a new object type to the various infrastructure
// elements of ToDD - it does not automatically give those objects meaning.

// pass in the original JSON (the "obj_json" param). This will identify the specific type and return that struct to you.
