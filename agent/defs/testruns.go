// TestRun is a struct  for a testrun command to be sent to the agent. This is not to be confused with the testrun object.
// Here, the "targets" property is a string slice - which means that the target type and targets have already been calculated by the server.
// This struct is sent to a specific agent so that it has the instructions it needs to perform a test.
