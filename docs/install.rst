Installing and/or Running ToDD
================================

First, make sure the following software is installed and correctly configured for your platform:

- Go (1.6 is the version tested for this documentation)
- Make sure the "bin" directory in your GOPATH is also added to your "PATH"
- Git

Install via Make
----------

The best way to install ToDD onto a system is with the provided Makefile. In this section, we'll retrieve the ToDD source, compile into the three ToDD binaries, and install these binaries onto the system.

First, let's ``go get`` the ToDD source. As mentioned at the beginning of this document, this assumes a system where Go has been properly set up:

.. code-block:: text

    go get -d github.com/Mierdin/todd

At this point, you may get an error along the lines of "no buildable GO source files in...". Ignore this error; you should still be able to install ToDD.

Navigate to the directory where Go would have downloaded ToDD. As an example:

.. code-block:: text

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Mierdin/todd

Finally, compile and install the binaries:

.. code-block:: text

    make
    sudo make install

Docker
----------
If you instead wish to run ToDD inside a Docker container, you can pull the current image from Dockerhub:

.. code-block:: text

    mierdin@todd-1:~$ docker pull mierdin/todd
    mierdin@todd-1:~$ docker run --rm mierdin/todd todd -h                        
    NAME:
       todd - A highly extensible framework for distributed testing on demand

    USAGE:
       todd [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

    VERSION:
       v0.1.0
    ......

The binaries below are distributed inside this container and can be run as commands on top of the "docker run" command:

- ``todd`` - the CLI client for ToDD
- ``todd-server`` - the ToDD server binary
- ``todd-agent`` - the ToDD agent binary

A Dockerfile for running any ToDD component (server/agent/client) is provided in the repository if you wish to build the image yourself. This Dockerfile is what's used to automatically build the Docker image within Dockerhub.

Vagrant
----------
There is also a provided vagrantfile in the repo. This is not something you should use to actually run ToDD in production, but it is handy to get a quick server stood up, alongside all of the other dependencies like a database.
