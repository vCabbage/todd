Collaboration
----------
ToDD has a `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/todd-dev/>`_, for all matters related to development, or questions about getting ToDD running on your own systems. Please feel free to join and send a message if you have any questions! We will be as helpful as possible.

Blogs
----------
I wrote a `blog post on ToDD <http://keepingitclassless.net/2016/03/test-driven-network-automation/>`_, as part of the release. Plenty of nice visuals!
